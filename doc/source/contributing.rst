it before attempting to contribute to the PyAnsys Tools Report repository.
 
The following contribution information is specific to the PyAnsys Tools Report repository.

Cloning the PyAnsys Tools Report repository
-------------------------------------------
Run this code to clone and install the latest version of the repository in development
mode:

.. code::

    git clone https://github.com/ansys/pyansys-tools-report.git
    cd pyansys-tools-report
    pip install .

    
In case of looking for the **test** requirements, run the following:

.. code::
    
    pip install .[test]


Building documentation
----------------------
To build the documentation locally you need to follow these steps at the root
directory of the repository:

.. code:: 

    pip install .[doc]
    make -C doc html

After the build completes the HTML documentation locates itself in the
``_builds/html`` directory and you can load the ``index.html`` into a web
browser. To clean the documentation you can execute this command:

.. code::

    make -C doc clean

Posting issues

Use the `PyAnsys Tools Report Issues <https://github.com/ansys/pyansys-tools-report/issues>`_ page to
submit questions, report bugs, and request new features.
